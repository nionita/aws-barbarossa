Optimisation Scripts for Barbarossa
-----------------------------------

This repo contains scripts which implement a few optimisation methods used by me to tune Barbarossa parameters.

Currently I implemented DSPSA and Bayesian optimisations.

The scripts should run locally or on AWS, but currently really tested is only the local functionality.
