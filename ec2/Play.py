Transforming mean result in an elo difference involves the constants log(10) and 400,
but at the end those are multiplicative, so it is just a matter of step size
Here frac is between 0 and 1, exclusive! More than 0.5 means the first player is better
We have guards for very excentric results, eps0 and eps1, which also limit the gradient amplitude:
